After a bank declares a debt as "uncollectable," it is classified as "charged-off." However, this doesn't imply that the bank abandons the debt altogether. The bank still aims to recover a portion of the owed money. In this project, we examine a scenario where delinquent customers were assigned to different recovery strategies based on the bank's estimation of the expected recovery amount. The objective for the data scientist is to analyze whether assigning customers to a higher recovery strategy, in a non-random manner, resulted in incremental earnings that outweighed the additional costs.

Similar threshold-based assignments are found in various domains, such as medicine (administering medication above a certain temperature), education (enrolling students in a special class based on a minimum test score), finance (providing different service levels to customers based on their wealth), and the public sector (providing housing benefits to individuals below a certain income threshold). Regression discontinuity analysis is an intuitive and valuable method for evaluating any situation involving a threshold-based assignment.

In this analysis, we employ the scipy Kruskal test and chi-square test to assess differences at the threshold and use the threshold indicator coefficient generated by the regression model to evaluate its impact on the dependent variable. This approach sheds light on whether it is financially beneficial for the bank to invest in debt collection efforts.
